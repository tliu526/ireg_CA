###__Week 1 Goals__
- Get a working simulation up and running, with rule applications and simple statistics tracking
- Concept of a Rule Table ("traditional" rule numbering/declarations) and Rule Mapping (to irregular grids)

Today I laid out the foundation of the Simulation class, and it now performs a dummy
simulation. Next steps are to continue to flesh out the Simulation so that actual
computation is being performed.

Things to keep in mind:
- Scriptability
- Modularity
