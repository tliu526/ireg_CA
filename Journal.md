This morning: implemented variatic Properties to be stored in cells using unions. GridGenerators can now write different property lists to file.

This afternoon: laid out foundation for Stencil class, which maps a rule table to an irregular neighborhood. SimpleMajorityRule almost complete.

###__Week 1 Goals__
- Get a working simulation up and running, with rule applications and simple statistics tracking
- Concept of a Rule Table ("traditional" rule numbering/declarations) and Rule Mapping (to irregular grids)

Today, laid out the foundation of the Simulation class, and it now performs a dummy
simulation. Next steps are to continue to flesh out the Simulation so that actual
computation is being performed.

Things to keep in mind:
- Scriptability
- Modularity
